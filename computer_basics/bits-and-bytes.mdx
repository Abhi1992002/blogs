## Bits and Bytes

- Computer works using 0s and 1s , but we do not work with them directly
- In computer we have electrical wires that carries information
- But how could you transfer information using wires, In wires , we could send electrical signal or we could not. We do have like 2 choices
- if wire sending us signal , we treat it as 1 and if not then we treat it as 0.
- Each 1 and 0 is called bits
- Suppose in 4sec, for first 2 second , wire is 1 and then 0 and then 1 => so he is telling me a number `13`.but how do i know that he is saying 13, for that you need to understand about `binary system`.
- Suppose we have 8 bits , so we can store a number upto 256 (2 ^ 8).and we call it a byte
- if we have 32 bits , then we could store upto 4 billion number..... and so on
- But a bigger question come , like how to store images , video , and sound
- see a image have millions of pixels , and each pixels have color and each color can be represented in number like rgb(255, 255, 255), and video is nothing but numbers of images and for a 1 minute of video (with 30fps), we need +3 billion pixels
- and for sound we have vibrations and we can represent them as series of number (bits)
