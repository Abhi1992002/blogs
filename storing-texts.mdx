## Storing texts

- for storing a non number thing in memory , we need some human intervention and we could create a encoding which a computer could use to convert text into number and store them and when we need these text , computer use these number and covert them again to text using that encoding
- and that encoding is ASCII encoding
- maximum value a n-bit architecture could store => 2^n -1
- possible values it can store => 2^n
- Each ASCII takes 7 bits of storage, and have support of 128 character
- Problem with ASCII are 1.) it uses 7 bits but computer typically store values in bytes 2.) It doesn't support special words like $ etc 3.) It is not compatible with other language like Chinese
- Then we introduces utf-8 , compatible with ASCII and solves its problem , i will not explain it in detail you can read it
- you just need to know that we use utf-8 to convert text into binary and binary into text
- it encodes 1 character into 1 byte and also we uses utf-8 to encode html page on web

```javascript
// Create a TextEncoder instance
const encoder = new TextEncoder();

// Encode a string into a Uint8Array of UTF-8 bytes
const text = "Hello, world!";
const encoded = encoder.encode(text);

// Log the encoded bytes
console.log(encoded);
// Output might look like: Uint8Array(13) [72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 44, 32, 119, 111, 114, 108, 100, 33]

// If you need to convert the Uint8Array back to a string, you can use TextDecoder
const decoder = new TextDecoder();
const decoded = decoder.decode(encoded);

// Log the decoded string
console.log(decoded);
// Output: Hello, world!
```
